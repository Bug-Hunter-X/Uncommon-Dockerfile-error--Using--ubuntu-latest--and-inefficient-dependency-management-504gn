# Uncommon Dockerfile Error: Using `ubuntu:latest` and Inefficient Dependency Management

This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution. The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is not recommended for production environments due to its instability, and employs a less-efficient method for managing dependencies.

The improved version uses a specific Ubuntu version, multi-stage builds for smaller image size, and a more optimized approach to dependency management.

**Problem:**

The original Dockerfile uses the latest version of Ubuntu, which is prone to changes between builds. This can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected errors.  Furthermore, copying the entire project and installing dependencies separately are suboptimal for larger projects.

**Solution:**

The updated Dockerfile addresses these issues by:

1. Specifying a precise Ubuntu version.
2. Using a multi-stage build to create a smaller, more efficient image.
3. Optimizing the dependency installation.

This approach results in a more stable, predictable, and streamlined Docker image.
